      <p>Hello everyone. My name is Elias Muzemil and I am on the autism spectrum. I am majoring in information technology and management and this will be my first semester at IIT. Prior to IIT, I took Truman college classes on C++ and Java programming, and I participated in Excelerate's online internship programs for data visualization, innovation and entrepreneurship, and cybersecurity. My goal is to get an A in this class and I am willing to work hard for it.</p>
