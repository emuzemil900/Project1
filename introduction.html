      <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1><img src="images/me.jpg" alt="Elias Muzemil (Me)">
      <p>Hello everyone. My name is Elias Muzemil and I am on the autism spectrum. I am majoring in information technology and management and this will be my first semester at IIT. Prior to IIT, I took Truman college classes on C++ and Java programming, and I participated in Excelerate's online internship programs for data visualization, innovation and entrepreneurship, and cybersecurity. My goal is to get an A in this class and I am willing to work hard for it.</p>
      <p>My family consists of my mother and father, who have divorced since I was in kindergarten, and my two older sisters; Sonia, who is currently 24 years old and lives in an apartment in Chicago, and Hanan, who is currently 26 years old, engaged, and will be officially wedded this December.</p>
